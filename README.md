# GlitchyPersona
a glitch in the system?

__Description:__ A glitch in informatics is usually defined as a short-lived fault in a system. It is often used to describe a transient fault that corrects itself, and is therefore difficult to troubleshoot. The "glitch filter" serve as a metaphor for a person that defies the system or status quo in the digital space. This is why in the followin work Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, Aaron Swartz (hacktivist), Anonymous and The Pirate Bay founders were selected.

DISCLAIMER: The people portrayed in these works of art are independent of my believes. In fact Aaron Swartz has been a great inspiration to me.
